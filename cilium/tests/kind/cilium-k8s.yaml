  # Identity allocation mode selects how identities are shared between cilium
  # nodes by setting how they are stored. The options are "crd" or "kvstore".
  # - "crd" stores identities in kubernetes as CRDs (custom resource definition).
  #   These can be queried with:
  #     kubectl get ciliumid
  # - "kvstore" stores identities in a kvstore, etcd or consul, that is
  #   configured below. Cilium versions before 1.6 supported only the kvstore
  #   backend. Upgrades from these older cilium versions should continue using
  #   the kvstore by commenting out the identity-allocation-mode below, or

# For cilium-operator running in HA mode.
#
# Cilium operator running in HA mode requires the use of ResourceLock for Leader Election
# between mulitple running instances.
# The preferred way of doing this is to use LeasesResourceLock as edits to Leases are less
# common and fewer objects in the cluster watch "all Leases".
# The support for leases was introduced in coordination.k8s.io/v1 during Kubernetes 1.14 release.
# In Cilium we currently don't support HA mode for K8s version < 1.14. This condition make sure
# that we only authorize access to leases resources in supported K8s versions.
